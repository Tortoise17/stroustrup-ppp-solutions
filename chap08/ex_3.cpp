/* Create a vector of Fibonacci numbers and print them using the
function from exercise 2. To create the vector, write a function,
fibonacci(x,y,v,n), where integers x and y are ints, v is an empty
vector<int>, and n is the number of elements to put into v; v[0] will
be x and v[1] will be y. A Fibonacci number is one that is part of a
sequence where each element is the sum of the two previous ones. For
example, starting with 1 and 2, we get 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . . . Your
fibonacci() function should make such a sequence starting with its x
and y arguments */
