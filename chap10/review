[Done lesser exercises as chapter project was quite extensive]

1. When dealing with input and output, how is the variety of devices dealt with in most modern computers?
    Different devices have device drivers for their input and output. An IO library accesses the drivers
    and abstracts the input and output process of drivers

2. What, fundamentally, does an istream do?
    Turns character sequences into values of various types.
    Gets characters from a console/file/memory

3. What, fundamentally, does an ostream do?
    Turns values of various types to character sequences and sends them to a console/file/memory.

4. What, fundamentally, is a file?
    Sequence of bytes

5.  What is a file format?
    Specifies type of data.

6. Name four different types of devices that can require I/O for a
program
    - Calculator program
    - Reminder program
    - Tip Calculator
    - Ping Pong game

7.  What are the four steps for reading a file?
    - Know the Name
    - Open for reading
    - Read in characters
    - Close (generally implicit)

8. What are the four steps for writing a file?
    - Name the file
    - Open for writing
    - Write objects
    - Close (generally implicit)

9. Name and define the four stream states.
    good() Operations successful
    eof() End of file
    fail() Something unexpected. [Maybe wrong type]
    bad() Serious error. Abort I/O

10. Discuss how the following input problems can be resolved:
    a. The user typing an out-of-range value
    b. Getting no value (end of file)
    c. The user typing something of the wrong type

    a. Prompting to re enter value or set default value
    b. Exit
    c. Prompting to re enter value or set default value

11. In what way is input usually harder than output?
    Several error possibilities:
        Wrong type
        Bad state
        etc.
    And take care of input format

12. In what way is output usually harder than input?
    Write the data in the correct format

13. Why do we (often) want to separate input and output from
computation?
    computation is related to program logic and operations on data
    Input and output are operations to deal with getting and writing data

14. What are the two most common uses of the istream member
function clear()?
    Remove error flag after bad() or fail() to retry input.
    - Check for terminating character
    - Retry input

15. What are the usual function declarations for << and >> for a userdefined type X?
    std::istream& operator<<(std::istream& is, Type& t);
    std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, Type& t);
