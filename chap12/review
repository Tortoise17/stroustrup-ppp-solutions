1. Why do we use graphics?
    Useful in areas - plotting data, showing images
    Fun - :)
    Provide an example for reading and writing code 
    Source of design techniques and decisions
    Introduction to OOP
    Key concepts are non trivial

2. When do we try not to use graphics?
    When layout can simply be expressed in plain text (markup)
    We use graphics when we want a direct correspondance between objects in memory
    and output on screen

3. Why is graphics interesting for a programmer?
    Endless possibilities of outputting something useful on screen
    Output of code is immediate and obvious (mostly)

4. What is a window?
    A rectangular area which contains our programs output.

5. In which namespace do we keep our graphics interface classes (our
graphics library)?
    Graph_lib

6.  What header files do you need to do basic graphics using our graphics
library?
    Window.h
    Graph.h

7. What is the simplest window to use?
    Simple_window with a next button

8. What is the minimal window?
    Window with no extra facilities built in and utilises the default OS window

9. What’s a window label?
    Title to label the window

10. How do you label a window?
    win.set_label("Label")

11. How do screen coordinates work? Window coordinates?
Mathematical coordinates?
    Screen is a rectangular area composed of pixels, a tiny spot
    Each pixel has an x, y coordinate
    x => Starts with 0 [Leftmost pixed] => Increases towards right
    y => Starts with 0 [Topmost pixel] => Increases downwards
    Mathematic coordinates start at bottom y=0

12. What are examples of simple “shapes” that we can display?
    line lines polygon axis rectangle text image

13. What command attaches a shape to a window?
    win.attach(shape)

14. Which basic shape would you use to draw a hexagon?
    Polygon

15. How do you write text somewhere in a window?
    Text t{Point{x, y}, "Hello World"};
    win.attach(t);

16. How would you put a photo of your best friend in a window (using a
program you wrote yourself)?
    Image i {Point{x, y}, "friend.jpg"};
    win.attach(i)

17. You made a Window object, but nothing appears on your screen.
What are some possible reasons for that?
    Did not use wait_for_button to display to screen
    Did not create window obj properly

18. You have made a shape, but it doesn’t appear in the window. What are
some possible reasons for that?
    Did not attach
        OR 
    Invisible color
