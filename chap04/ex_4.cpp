/* Write a program to play a numbers guessing game. The user thinks of
a number between 0 and 100 and your program asks questions to
figure out what the number is (e.g., “Is the number you are thinking of
less than 50?”). Your program should be able to identify the number
after asking no more than seven questions. Hint: Use the < and <=
operators and the if-else construct. */
