/* . Create a program to find all the prime numbers between 1 and 100.
One way to do this is to write a function that will check if a number is
prime (i.e., see if the number can be divided by a prime number
smaller than itself) using a vector of primes in order (so that if the
vector is called primes, primes[0]==2, primes[1]==3,
primes[2]==5, etc.). Then write a loop that goes from 1 to 100,
checks each number to see if it is a prime, and stores each prime found
in a vector. Write another loop that lists the primes you found. You
might check your result by comparing your vector of prime numbers
with primes. Consider 2 the first prime.
