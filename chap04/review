1. What is a computation?
  Act of producing outputs based on some inputs

2. What do we mean by inputs and outputs to a computation? Give
examples
  Inputs are the values provided by the user to the program through means like keyboard,
  mice, IR sensors etc. Output is the final result after computing the inputs.
  Eg: A square root program can accept integer like 64 and return output 8 after computation

3. What are the three requirements a programmer should keep in mind
when expressing computations
  Correctly, simply, efficiently

4. What does an expression do?
  Computes value from number of operands

5. What is the difference between a statement and an expression, as
described in this chapter?
  An expression computes values from number of operands.
  A set of instructions performing an action is a statement.

6. What is an lvalue? List the operators that require an lvalue. Why do
these operators, and not the others, require an lvalue?
  Value appearing on left side of assignment where operator modifies operand.
  - Pre/post increment, pre/post decrement, assignment, compound assignment
  They are modifying the value of the expression

7. What is a constant expression?
  An expression exclusively consisting of constants

8. What is a literal?
  An expression with distinct value

9. What is a symbolic constant and why do we use them?
  A named object who's value cannot be altered after initialization
  Used for values which shouldnt change during compile time. 
  Eg: Value of PI must not change after initializing as 3.14159 or 3.14

10. What is a magic constant? Give examples.
  Non obvious literals used outside of symbolic constants.
  Eg: 
    double energy = f * 6.62607015 * 1 / pow(10, 34); // X
    int energy = f * PLANCK_CONSTANT; // ✓

11. What are some operators that we can use for integers and floatingpoint values?
  Arithmetic: Increment, Decrement, Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
  IO: Write value to ostream <<, Read value from istream >>
  Logical Operations: > < >= <= == != && |
  Assignments: =    *= -= += %= 
  Only Integers: Modulus

12. What operators can be used on integers but not on floating-point
numbers?
  Modulus (%) operator

13. What are some operators that can be used for strings?
  Operations: Concat(+)
  Logical: == !=
  IO: >> , <<
  Assignment: = +=
  
14. When would a programmer prefer a switch-statement to an ifstatement?
  When Comparing against several constants

15. What are some common problems with switch-statements?
  > Using variables in switch instead of constants
  > Forgetting break after case

16. What is the function of each part of the header line in a for-loop, and
in what sequence are they executed?
  for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  i. initialize variable for iterating over loop
  ii. Loop until condition remains true - Until i reaches 100
  iii. Increment i at each iteration
    Note to self:
    (++pre - value is incremented then used
    post++ - value is used then incremented)

17. When should the for-loop be used and when should the while-loop
be used?
  For loop: Use of initializer, condition and increment/decrement operation
  While: Independent of initializer and inc/dec operation

18. How do you print the numeric value of a char?
  Casting to type int;
  int my_int = char_value; OR cout << int(char_value)

19. Describe what the line char foo(int x) means in a function definition
  Define function named foo accepting one parameter x as integer and returning a char value

20. When should you define a separate function for part of a program?
List reasons.
  - Makes computation logically seperate
  - Makes program clearer
  - Allows reusability without rewriting entire logic
  - Eases testing and debugging

21. What can you do to an int that you cannot do to a string?
  - / % *

22. What can you do to a string that you cannot do to an int?
  Concatenation 
  
23. What is the index of the third element of a vector?
  2

24. How do you write a for-loop that prints every element of a vector?
  for(type x : vec) cout << x;

25. What does vector<char> alphabet(26); do?
  Initializes vector with 26 empty char values

26. Describe what push_back() does to a vector.
  Adds element to end of vector

27. What do vector’s member functions begin(), end(), and size() do?
  begin(): Return pointer pointing to first el of vector
  end(): Return pointer pointing to last el of vector
  size(): Return no. of elements in vector

28. What makes vector so popular/useful?
  Store, manipulate and use series of values

29. How do you sort the elements of a vector?
  sort(v.begin(), v.end())
