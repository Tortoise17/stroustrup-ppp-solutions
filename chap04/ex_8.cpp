/* There is an old story that the emperor wanted to thank the inventor of
the game of chess and asked the inventor to name his reward. The
inventor asked for one grain of rice for the first square, 2 for the
second, 4 for the third, and so on, doubling for each of the 64 squares.
That may sound modest, but there wasn’t that much rice in the empire!
Write a program to calculate how many squares are required to give
the inventor at least 1000 grains of rice, at least 1,000,000 grains, and
at least 1,000,000,000 grains. You’ll need a loop, of course, and
probably an int to keep track of which square you are at, an int to keep
the number of grains on the current square, and an int to keep track of
the grains on all previous squares. We suggest that you write out the
value of all your variables for each iteration of the loop so that you can
see what’s going on.
