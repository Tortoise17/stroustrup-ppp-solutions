1. Why don’t we “just” use a commercial or open-source graphics library
directly?
    Reduce complexity of GUI library
    Make interfaces portable with other libraries
    Learn Graphics Concepts

2. About how many classes from our graphics interface library do you
need to do simple graphics output?
    2 Dozen

3. What are the header files needed to use the graphics interface library?
    fltk.h
    Graph.h 
    GUI.h
    Point.h
    Window.h

4. What classes define closed shapes?
    Closed_polyline
    Polygon
    Rectangle
    Circle
    Ellipse

5. Why don’t we just use Line for every shape?
    Provide simple implementation by specifying only vertices

6. What do the arguments to Point indicate?
    x and y coordinates on canvas

7. What are the components of Line_style?
    Line style type
    Width

8. What are the components of Color?
    Color type
    visibility

9. What is RGB?
    A color model used to describe colors as frequencies of Red Green and Blue

10. What are the differences between two Lines and a Lines containing
two lines?
    Two lines are two independent objects having a start and end coordinate for the line
    Lines object contains collection of ``Line``s object defined by pairs

11. What properties can you set for every Shape?
    Points
    Color
    Fill Color
    Line style
    Move

12. How many sides does a Closed_polyline defined by five Points
have?
    6

13. What do you see if you define a Shape but don’t attach it to a
Window?
    Nothing

14. How does a Rectangle differ from a Polygon with four Points
(corners)?
    90deg angles
    equal diagonals
    Opposite sides equal

15. How does a Polygon differ from a Closed_polyline?
    Polygon does not allow lines to cross

16. What’s on top: fill or outline?
    outline

17. Why didn’t we bother defining a Triangle class (after all, we did
define Rectangle)?
    Rectangles are more common on screens and coordinate systems

18.  How do you move a Shape to another place in a Window?
    move() function

19. How do you label a Shape with a line of text?
    Insert Text Object inside it

20. What properties can you set for a text string in a Text
    Color Font Size Point

21. What is a font and why do we care?
    Style of text. Readability on screen

22. What is Vector_ref for and how do we use it?
    Store named and unnamed elements

23. What is the difference between a Circle and an Ellipse?
    Circle has constant radius
    Ellipse has major and minor axis

24. What happens if you try to display an Image given a file name that
doesn’t refer to a file containing an image?
    It shows a bad image

25. How do you display part of an image?
    set_mask()
