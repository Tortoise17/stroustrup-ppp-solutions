1. What does "Caveat emptor!" mean?
    "let the buyer beware"
    It is to avoid disputes due to lack of information to buyer which is known to the seller
    <use vectors over arrays>

2. What is the default meaning of copying for class objects?
    Shallow copying 

3. When is the default meaning of copying of class objects appropriate?
    When is it inappropriate?
    Appropriate when class objects do not contain pointers
    inappropriate when class objects contain pointers

4. What is a copy constructor?
    Constructor for class from another class object
    X a = b

5. What is a copy assignment?
    Modify class object when assigned another class object
    X a{2};
    X b{3};
    a = b;

6. What is the difference between copy assignment and copy
initialization?
    Copy assignment is overloading of operator=. It modifies its members according to assigned class object
    
    Copy initialization or constructor is a variant of regular constructor when a class object is passed 
    by reference as an argument

7. What is shallow copy? What is deep copy?
    Shallow copy copies address of pointers to the other
    Deep copy creates a copy of the pointed to object in memory and stores its address

    Therefore, working on a duplicate class object using shallow copy
    modifies the original class object

8. How does the copy of a vector compare to its source?
    Same size
    Elements have the same value but are stored in different locations

9. What are the five "essential operations" for a class?
    Constructor with arguments
    Default Constructor
    Copy Constructor / assignment
    Move constructor / assignment
    Destructor

10. What is an explicit constructor? Where would you prefer one over
the (default) alternative?
    explicit constructor avoids the implicit conversion from one type to another 
    when the constructor takes one argument
    
    Eg: fn(vector& v) {}
        
        // implicit int to vector
        vector v = 10; // makes vector with 10 doubles
        fn(10) // call vector with 10 doubles

11. What operations may be invoked implicitly for a class object?
    
12. What is an array?
    An array is a homogenous sequence of objects allocated in contiguous memory

13. How do you copy an array?
    Arrays cannot be assigned to only initialized

    Use: memcpy(), std::copy, using for loop

14. How do you initialize an array?
    <type> <name>[<size>] = {<el1>, <el2> ... };

15. When should you prefer a pointer argument over a reference
argument? Why?
    Pointer argument allows it to point to different locations at different times
    Pointer to arrays allows iteration
    When nullptr is a valid argument (and check for it)

16. What is a C-style string?
    An array of characters which is null(0) terminated

17. What is a palindrome?
    Text which is read same forwards and backwards
