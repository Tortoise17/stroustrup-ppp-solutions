1 The Imitation Game

I propose to consider the question, “Can machines think?” This should begin
with definitions of the meaning of the terms “machine” and “think.” The defi-
nitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the
words, but this attitude is dangerous, If the meaning of the words “machine” and
“think” are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult
to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, “Can
machines think?” is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll.
But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the
question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively
unambiguous words

As well as asking, “What is the answer to this new form of the question,” one
may ask, “Is this new question a worthy one to investigate?” This latter question
we investigate without further ado, thereby cutting short an infinite regress

	The new problem has the advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line between
the physical and the intellectual capacities of a man. No engineer or chemist
claims to be able to produce a material which is indistinguishable from the
human skin. It is possible that at some time this might be done, but even sup-
posing this invention available we should feel there was little point in trying to
make a “thinking machine” more human by dressing it up in such artificial flesh.
The form in which we have set the problem reflects this fact in the condition
which prevents the interrogator from seeing or touching the other competitors,
or hearing -their voices. Some other advantages of the proposed criterion may
be shown up by specimen questions and answers. Thus:

	Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.
	A: Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.
	Q: Add 34957 to 70764.
	A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621.
	Q: Do you play chess?
	A: Yes.
	Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R
	at R1. It is your move. What do you play?
	A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate
