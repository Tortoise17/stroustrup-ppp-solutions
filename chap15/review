1. What is a function of one argument?

2. When would you use a (continuous) line to represent data? When do
you use (discrete) points?
    Continuous line can be used to represent data which behaves as a function or show 
    the trend of a given quantity 

    Discrete points can be used when the points do not follow a particular behaviour or simply represent
    value of one quantity at a given instance

3. What function (mathematical formula) defines a slope? 
    tan(Î¸) = dy/dx

4. What is a parabola?
    A plane curve which is mirror-symmetrical and U shaped.

5. How do you make an x axis? A y axis?
    Using Axis object

6. What is a default argument and when would you use one?
    An optional paramater for a function with a default value
    It can be used to keep a default value for a quantity in case the value isn't specified
    Eg: int replace_substr(std::string str, std::string search, std::string replace int start_index = 0)
        std::vector<string> split(std::string str, char sep = ' ')

7. How do you add functions together?
    Use lambda functions or use one in the other

8. How do you color and label a graphed function?
    fct.set_color()
    Use text labels

9. What do we mean when we say that a series approximates a function?
    Approximates the value of a function as an expansion series
    Each additional term betters the approximation

10. Why would you sketch out the layout of a graph before writing the
code to draw it?
    Easier to visualize and prevent errors

11. How would you scale your graph so that the input will fit?
    scale = axis_length / range_of_input
    
12. How would you scale the input without trial and error?
    scale = axis_length / range_of_input

13. Why would you format your input rather than just having the file
contain "the numbers"?
    Easier to modify, debug, understand and maintain

14. How do you plan the general layout of a graph? How do you reflect
that layout in your code?
    - Position axis using offsets
    - Scale axis length and range
    - Use a scale object for the same
    - Label axis
    - Use colors and labels

Lambda expressions:
[](double x) { return cos(x) + slope(x); }
[](double x) -> double { return cos(x) + sin(x); } // specifying return type is optional as it is automatically deduced
